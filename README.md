Missing diaries is a **DApp** which keeps the record of missing people around us. The application is composed of the following features:

  * **Missing Person:** The DApp store data of missing persons. Specifically, it stores
    a person's name, age, height, status(either “missing” or “found”),
    small description, division from where the person got missing and a relative’s
    contact number.
  * **Add Data:** Users can post data of missing people. Added data is
    visible to the user without refreshing the page right after posting it. (Implemented using the event in SOLIDITY)
  * **Actions:** Users are able to search missing people by filtering 8 divisions 
    of bangladesh. For example: Dhaka, Chittagong etc. In addition to that, missing 
    count of all of the eight districts in ascending or descending order and the 
    median value of missing persons count among them are shown. (This is implemented in the front end using the javascript)
